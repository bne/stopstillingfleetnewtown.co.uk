title: Help Protect Local Ancient Woodland
description: Selby District Council is consulting on building large numbers of new homes on a greenfield site
suggestions:
  - A large housing development at STIL-D would harm the area in many ways that would get worse over time
  - A large housing development at STIL-D would completely change the landscape setting from greenfield to suburban
  - A large housing development at STIL-D would cause pollution from construction dust and then from garden chemicals and vehicles, pollution that affects trees, plants, lichens and animals
  - A large housing development at STIL-D would disturb sensitive ecological systems at Heron Wood and also Moreby Wood through light and noise pollution
  - A large housing development at STIL-D would drive away the owls, bats and other creatures that use Heron Wood and Moreby wood and the fields around them
  - A large housing development at STIL-D would lead to damage to both Heron Wood and Moreby Wood from fly-tipping, from vandalism, and from trampling on delicate soils
  - A large housing development at STIL-D would lead to major disturbance to birds, mammals and amphibians from domestic pets in both Heron Wood and Moreby Wood
  - If the development at STIL-D were to go ahead, major harm to the ancient woodlands Heron Wood and Moreby Wood cannot be avoided by "sensitive" housebuilding methods. It’s unavoidable that an ancient woodland in the middle of, or right next to, a large housing development will be seriously harmed
  - The Government's National Policy Planning Framework says that development resulting in the loss or deterioration of ancient woodland should be refused, unless there are wholly exceptional reasons.  Here there are no such exceptional reasons, and there are viable alternative options for large scale housing development on brownfield sites at Burn and Church Fenton. The proposal at STIL-D should never have been put forward and should not be taken any further forward

        <p>Selby District Council is consulting right now on a New Local Plan for growth in the district up to 2040.</p>
        <p>The consultation ends on <strong>March 12th 2021</strong>.</p>
        <p>In that Plan there are three different options for large scale new housing development.</p>
        <p>One of those options - called STIL-D - is to build 1260 new homes, rising to 3000 eventually, on a greenfield site west of the A19 south of the Escrick-Stillingfleet Road.</p>
        <p>The other possible new settlement sites are at Burn airbase and Church Fenton airbase, both brownfield sites.</p>

        <figcaption>Indicative dwelling capacity: up to 3,000 Dwellings (1,260 of which are projected to be built within the plan period)</figcaption>
        <p>The proposed site for a new settlement is located to the south west of Escrick Village to the East of the Former Selby Mine. The land is currently used for agriculture and is in single ownership.</p>

        <h3>The STIL-D housing development proposal is a major threat to precious ancient woodlands at Heron Wood and Moreby Wood</h3>
        <p>One ancient woodland - Heron Wood - is right in the centre of the proposed development site. A second ancient woodland - Moreby Wood - is just across the Escrick-Stillingfleet Road.</p>
        <p>These ancient woodlands are delicate and irreplaceable ecosystems as well as beautiful. Public bridleways run through both woodlands so their beauty can be seen and shared by all.</p>
        <p>If the development at STIL-D were to go ahead, major harm to the ancient woodlands Heron Wood and Moreby Wood cannot be avoided by "sensitive" housebuilding methods. It’s unavoidable that an ancient woodland in the middle of, or right next to, a large housing development will be seriously harmed.</p>
        <p>The developer proposing STIL-D also owns Heron Wood. He is not going to speak up in its defence: that’s down to all of us!</p>
