description: Selby District Council is Consulting on Building Large Numbers of New Homes on A Greenfield Site
---

Selby District Council is consulting right now on a New Local Plan for growth in the district up to 2040. The consultation ends on March 12. In that Plan there are three different options for large scale new housing development. One of those options - called STIL-D â€“ is to build 1260 new homes, rising to 3000 eventually, on a greenfield site west of the A19 south of the Escrick-Stillingfleet Road. The other possible new settlement sites are at Burn airbase and Church Fenton airbase, both brownfield sites.
